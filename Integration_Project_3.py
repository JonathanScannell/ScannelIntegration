# Jonathan Scannell
# My code helps you find out how many calories you are supposed to eat in a day
# I used a TDEE calculator to find how many calories one should eat in a day
# The calorie intake will be decided by taking your weight age height and whether you are a male or female and plugging it into an equation
# The cutting and bulking are found by taking away 500 calories and adding 500 calories
# This program will also give you a workout split based off of your level of businesses and a workout plan including how much cardio you should do a week
